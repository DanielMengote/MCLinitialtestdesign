              <p>Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr., commonly referred to as Bongbong and by the initials BBM, was born on the 13th of September 1957 in the town of Batac, Ilocos Norte.  He attended La Salle Greenhills elementary school (1964), and completed his secondary education at Worth School in West Sussex, England (1974).  He earned a Special Diploma in Social Studies from Oxford University (1978).  Bongbong subsequently enrolled at the Wharton School of Business for a Master of Business Administration, which was eventually cut short due to him being elected in 1980 as Vice Governor of his home province, Ilocos Norte.</p>
